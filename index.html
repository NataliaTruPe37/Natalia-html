        <h1>Background</h1> <!-- For the title-->
    </p>Being 20 years old and studying software engineering in college has been quite an unexpected journey for me. To be honest, I never really saw myself diving into this field. Back in high school, I imagined my future differently, and the idea of studying software engineering wasn’t even on my radar. The transition from high school to college was not just about shifting academic focus but also about adapting to an entirely new environment. The people I’m surrounded by now are very different from the friends I used to hang out with in high school.

    In high school, I was used to a certain social circle, people who shared the same interests and outlook on life. But in college, the diversity of backgrounds, interests, and personalities has been both a challenge and a learning experience. I found myself stepping out of my comfort zone, engaging with new perspectives, and growing in ways I hadn’t anticipated. Although it was tough at first, I soon realized that these differences were helping me to broaden my own horizons and develop a more open-minded approach to life.
    
    Despite the initial struggles, my time in college has turned out to be a wonderful experience. The challenges have pushed me to grow, and I’ve learned so many new skills that I never thought I would. The coursework, although demanding, has sparked a deep interest in technology and problem-solving. Each project and assignment has been a step forward, not just in terms of academics, but also in building my confidence and preparing me for the professional world. I’m now more hopeful and excited about the possibilities that lie ahead, and I’m determined to succeed in my professional life.
    
    On a personal level, I’ve always considered myself to be a fun-loving and happy person. I genuinely enjoy making people laugh and bringing a sense of joy to those around me. Being friendly and approachable has always been a big part of who I am, and I love that I can brighten someone’s day with just a joke or a smile. My passion for sports has also been a constant in my life since I can remember. I’ve played a variety of sports over the years, but soccer has always been my absolute favorite. There’s something about the game that just resonates with me the teamwork, the strategy, the physicality it’s all something I deeply enjoy and something that has always been a big part of my life. Playing soccer not only keeps me active but also gives me a sense of camaraderie and belonging, much like the friendships.
    
    As I continue on this path, I’m excited about what the future holds. I hope to merge my love for technology with my passion for sports, finding a way to incorporate both into my career. Although the journey hasn’t been exactly what I expected, it has been incredibly rewarding, and I’m eager to see where it leads me. </p>
